# entitygen

This is a first attempt at producing an RPG entity generator for DMs that's customizable, so that a DM can build an NPC or an encounter table and also roll it in the same tool. The entity generator is designed for easy generation of nested entities as well, so that you could build an 'atomic' entity such as a random name generator and also build larger entities composed of entities themselves, such as an NPC generator, a city generator (including NPCs, factions, etc.), or even a whole world generator.

Given that I know how to create JS objects and JSON output, the project needs little in the way of an interface in the beginning. The first contribution is simply a format for creating procedural entities useful to a DM, represented as JS objects (the input) and/or JSON (the output).
